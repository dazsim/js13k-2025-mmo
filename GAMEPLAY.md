Artwork will be encoded as binary and decompressed when the game loads. Once decoded, art can be redrawn in a variety of colours. For uniqueness a world should have a seed built up of colours used to recolour things. e.g. one world might have a green landscape while another might have red. raw metal resources should remain fixed colours but the stone might vary in colour. art will be simple and will loosely resemble the same level of quality you might see in original head over heels for the amstrad so only a few colours to keep space down. being able to recolour elements means e.g. for an ingot I can have 1 ingot image stored and then recolour for each resource. Makes extending the game easy as well.
